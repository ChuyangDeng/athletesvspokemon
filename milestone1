Project Name: Athlets VS Pokemon

Description: In this project, our team will design and develop a web application over different datasets. Two major datasets we are using are: 1) Olympic medal winners: every one since 1896 as open data; 2) Nintendo Pokedex: all pocket monsters from 6 generations.

Team Members:
Na Luo: luona@seas.upenn.edu
Yan Zhong: yanzhong@seas.upenn.edu
Chuyang Deng: chuyang@seas.upenn.edu

Technologies: Technologies that we are going to use are as follows
- AWS to host datasets
- Node.js (Environment to run Express)
- Express (Set up server)
- AngularJS (Implement User Interface)

Possible Query Questions:
(In general, we match each athlete to a particular Pokemon; we also match period of years to Pokemon generations, and sports to Pokemon categories.)
- Who is the Usain Bolt in Pokemon? (We rescale the speed/power/etc. in Pokemon and match their rank with athletes)
- Who is the fastest person/Pokemon?
- What will swimming athletes do in the Pokemon world? (We match each sport with a category of Pokemon so that users could know what kind of activities atheletes will do if they were Pokemon)
- Who will win if Micheal Phelps battles Ian Thorpe?
- Who are the first/second/... generations of Olympic athletes?
- Who is the Pikachu/Squirtle/Charmander among all Olympic athletes? (Popularity, based on news coverage/twitter feeds)
- personal info & pokemon attributes (这一点我忘记是怎么说的了。。。)
